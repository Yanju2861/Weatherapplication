# Weatherapplication
This project is about a weather application which is developed by Adebiyi Adeyanju. In building this project, I used html ,css and javascript for the fontend and I used MYSQL for the backend development(html,css,javascript,MYSQL). I also used postman(https://www.postman.com/) to retrieve data from openweathermap  api(https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) in json format. The data was used in developing this project(frontend and backend).
